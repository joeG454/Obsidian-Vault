Javascript Closures are functions that can access values outside of their lexical scope[^1] . In order to call a function in your code the JS interpeter needs to know about the function itself and any surrounding data the function depends on.

When we look at a function that is fully self contained, and only relies on its own data we have a fully self contained, closed expression:

```js
function pureFun(a, b) {
	return a + b;
}
```

When its called its pushed onto the [[Call Stack|call stack]] where its executed and its internal data is only kept in memory until its popped back off the [[Call Stack|call stack]]. 

But when a function references data outside of its scope that gives an open expression that references other free variables throughout the enviroment

In order for the JS intrepreter to call this function and also know the value of these free variables it creates a Closure to store them in a place in memory where they can be accessed later. That memory is called the [[Heap|heap]] and unlike the [[Call Stack|call stack]] which is short lived it can keep memory indefinitely. Because of this closures use more memory and processing power than a typical function.

>So a closure is not just a function, its a function combined with its outer state or lexical enviroment

The most common use of closures is for data encapsulation[^2] 

```js
function outer() {
	let state = 'bunny';
	
	function inner() {
		return 'Hello ${state}';
	}
	
	return inner;
}
```

By defining an outer function that contains the state and an inner function that operates on it the data container here will not leak out to the surrounding enviroment. The `inner()` function has access to data defined in the `outer()` function's scope. But the `outer()` function does not have access to the `inner()` function


[^1]: In a programming language, an item's lexical scope isÂ **the place in which it was created when it is created**.
[^2]: The mechanism whereby the data or state of an object is kept hidden to prevent leaking or exposing data where it is not needed
